public class apple {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		double tuna;
		tuna = 5.28;

}
// Explain Points:
// Above program tells following thing:
// >> syste.out.println will take the cursor to next line
// >> where as system.out.print keeps it in the same line
// >> public static void main(String[] args) is creating a method called main
// everything runs under main,
// without method name main program will not run and the mentioned statement is method
// header and whatever written inside it is method body.
